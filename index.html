			</div>
			<div class="text-block-info">
				<p>
					The Logistics Alliance (TLA) has forged strong partnerships with professional service providers and suppliers to permit an extensive network of trusted, independent professionals with extensive experience in Defence and Government. Through this network, TLA can offer a comprehensive service capability, to consistently delegate and assign tasks to people and teams who are experts in their field. This will ensure that our Government (defence) clients have access to best practice solutions through a single professional relationship. An added value of this business model is that TLA can offer depth (peer review and reach back) and redundancy in any individual or team composition that is assigned to a Defence role.
				</p>
				<h2>Management Structure</h2>
				<p>
					The management structure of TLA is established around the Directors of the three principal companies of the alliance. For each Defence engagement, a TLA Director will be appointed as the Engagement Director, providing a direct and flat management structure with clear lines of responsibility and accountability. The Engagement Director will oversee the development of proposals and is responsible to maintain regular and agreed contact with the client to ensure that outcomes are achieved. Our Directors will also conduct formal task reviews at pre-agreed milestones in accordance with the extant Quality Manual for TLA.
				</p>
				<h2>Use of resources</h2>
				<p>
					TLA has experienced business managers. The nature of our business is to offer exceptional quality of service, while operating within our targeted utilisation rates. TLA, as a collective group, strives to achieve 70% resource utilisation, reserving a minimum of 10% for business development and research. This approach provides for between 10% and 30% of our combined resources being available to respond to new opportunities and to ensure we have surge capacity in meeting contracted obligations (current and future). As the utilisation increases for a particular skill set, that is the trigger to hire additional resources in that area.

					TLA, collectively, has delivery operations in Canberra, Melbourne, Sydney, Adelaide and Hobart. Our resources are able to travel to undertake work where we lack a physical presence, otherwise TLA have sufficient office space for expansion through flexible office arrangements throughout Australian capital cities. TLA continues to attract high calibre individuals who value our culture of integrity and innovation.
				</p>
				<p>
					Wherever possible, TLA seeks to invest in its workforce through employment contracts in preference to short term contracts. Where required, however, TLA makes use of professional service providers through short term contracts in order to fill any immediate resource gaps. Professional Service Providers in these circumstances are invariably sourced through our own networks, in preference to labour hire agencies, enabling us to secure staff who have relevant experience in Defence and who carry appropriate security clearances.
